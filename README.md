A simple and effective iOS Application where a user is able to create, read, and delete tasks for better organization of their day to day activities. 

During this project, I was introduced to MongoDB Realm as a database, using CRUD actions to save and create and completed tasks. I Utilized SwiftUI for 
sheet presentations along with modifiers such as *swipe actions* and *on tap gestures*.
